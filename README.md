This is a mathematical model being used to maximize returns and minimize risk through the calculation of a necessary cash reserve. This model forecasts for three years from the investment start date. This tool allows for the selection of many individual traded securities, for demonstration purposes we will be choosing five securities from different economic sectors.

This tool will visualize VaR, ES and a cash reserve based on the inputs.

This project is influenced by the Fama-French three and five factor models.

This project is authored by Dave and Ben.
